				<div class="message-text">Hi Ji, <br><br>Meeting you was completely unexpected, but it has become the happiest surprise God has given me. Even though I am still finding myself, learning, growing, and figuring out who I am, I found you, the one who has become the love of my life.
                    <br><br>I know I am not perfect. I have my insecurities, my flaws, and days when I donâ€™t even love myself. I overthink, make mistakes, and sometimes feel lost. But somehow,YOU SEE ME. YOU LOVE ME. YOU CHOOSE ME. Even when you could have anyone else, you chose me, and that means more to me than I can ever put into words.

                    <br><br>I am forever thankful to God because He let me love you and be loved by you. Thank you for inspiring me every day to grow and become the person I am meant to be. God is indeed good, because every time I spend time with you, I see a blessing from Him. I promise that for you, with God, I will always strive to be better.

					<br><br>I am so happy that we found each other, and for me, the best part of me is you...<br><br>
